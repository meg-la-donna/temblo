Pop culture personality tests are so accurate, it's scary! ðŸ˜±

But how do they see into your actual soul?

Despite what *Buzzfeed* would have you believe, they don't. They just have the uncanny ability of rewording what you've already told them.

---

The personality tests you find on the internet don't tell you anything you did not know before. They just reword the information you give them. They explain your answers back to you, sometimes in ways you have not thought of before. These tests often seem to make a lot of sense. Like how did they know that I'm cheddar cheese? And they are popular. 

They give you the **language** you need to describe yourself.

That language is empowering! You will find it easier to understand and express how you think, act, and relate to others. You will understand yourself and those around you better. But there is a problem. 

Pop psychology doesn't give you the credit you deserve. Online tests do not always give you reliable information. And worse still, they assume you don't know what you are doing. 

This is where it all breaks down. You've been in your own mind for ever, and you are well acquainted. It does you a disservice to present a dumbed down or contrived version of psychological personality testing that is not based in **scientific research**. You deserve better information than that.
